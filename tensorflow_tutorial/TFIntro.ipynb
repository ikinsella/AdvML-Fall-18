        "# A Modern Introduction to Tensorflow (Advanced ML 2018)\n",
        "\n",
        "*\\[Some brief acknowledgments - this tutorial has been adapted from a few tutorials done by <a href=\"https://github.com/wendazhou\">Wenda Zhou</a> (including one created for last year's iteration of this course), so thanks to him!\\]*\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook is a quick (i.e about 75 minutes) introduction to <a href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/\">Tensorflow</a>, from the point of view of using Tensorflow via Python notebooks, and in particular doing so via Google's <a href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/\">Colab</a>. Tensorflow is an open source framework for **high performance machine learning** - while you don't need Tensorflow to run a logistic regression (although as we'll see, you can easily do so), you'll need something like it to perform the heavy lifting for the types of models we'll come across in the second half of the course.\n",
        "\n",
        "From a technical standpoint, Tensorflow combines the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   the ability to define computations in a symbolic manner and extract derivatives automatically by back-propagation;\n",
        "*   the ability to execute these operations on a variety of hardware, including GPUs and TPUs (GPUs are great for general purpose parallization; TPUs are great at multipling tensors together, which happens *a lot* when training deep networks).\n",
        "\n",
        "The benefit to you is that this allows you to focus on\n",
        "\n",
        "* specifying the model (i.e the architecture of your neural network);\n",
        "* specifying the loss (e.g cross entropy for classifcation, squared loss for regression etc); and\n",
        "* specifying the mode of training (e.g SGD, Adam etc);\n",
        "\n",
        "rather than the technical aspects of the implementation of the training procedure. I'll also briefly introduce a diagnostic tool called <a href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/summaries_and_tensorboard\">Tensorboard</a>, which will be helpful for examining the progress of the training procedure of your model.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Prerequisites\n",
        "In the tutorial, I'll be assuming \n",
        "\n",
        "* that you're comfortable (or at least, not uncomfortable) with Python 3 - see the <a href=\"https://github.com/ikinsella/AdvML-Fall-18/blob/master/python_tutorial/Tutorial.ipynb\">tutorial from the start of the semester</a> if you'd like a refresher;\n",
        "* that you have an understanding of the content from the 'Neural Networks' section from the first half of the course. (If you don't feel comfortable with it, I highly recommend investing some time now making yourself so, as the next half of the course is going to build on this *a lot*.)\n",
        "\n",
        "I'll also be assuming that you're running the tutorial in Colab. The main benefit of this is that this will not require any installation of Tensorflow. \n",
        "\n",
        "If you want to run this locally, then you will need to <a href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/install/\">install Tensorflow and Tensorboard yourself</a>. **WARNING: We will not provide ANY assistance if you have issues installing or running Tensorflow locally on your laptop.** (If you are using Colab, the hardware factor in diagnosing e.g bugs in code is removed, and it's suprising how frequently this can be a factor.)"

        "* that in Tensorflow we begin by building a computational graph which we then execute (in contrast to regular Python)\n",
        "* in Tensorflow, we work with tensors, and there are different types of tensors for whether they e.g store the trainable parameters of our network or the training data\n",
        "* there are several APIs available to help us in loading our data, building and training our model, along with how to keep track of useful diagnostic information\n",
        "* we can use Tensorboard (even in Colab) to help visualize e.g the graph of the network, the progress of training etc.\n",

        "A few last words and bits of advice:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Coding in Tensorflow can be frustrating, and the errors it can spit out are you aren't always...illuminating. **Google and StackOverflow will be your friends.**\n",
        "* If you want to know more about how Tensorflow works, there is a [guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/) available on the Tensorflow website which gives a nice breakdown of the APIs and their features. \n",
        "* Tensorflow is still an evolving language, with the 'best practices' changing frequently (although this has begin to stabilize over the past couple of months). Take this into account when looking at tutorials online. \n",
        "* Deep learning is as much of an art (if not more) than a science. **If you want to improve, you should practice.**"
